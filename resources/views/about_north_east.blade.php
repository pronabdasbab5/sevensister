              </h2>
              <p class="paragraph">The North East India comprises of the seven sister states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram,  Nagaland  and Tripura.  They form part of the   East Himalayan  region which extends from Sikkim eastwards  and   embraces  the  Darjeeling Hills  of West  Bengal. The   location  of  the  region is  strategically important as   it has  international  borders  with Bangladesh, Bhutan,   China, Myanmar and Tibet. The area is characterised by rich  bio-diversity, heavy  precipitation  and high seismicity. It is endowed with forest wealth and is  ideally  suited to  produce a  whole range of plantation   crops, spices, fruits and vegetables and flowers and herbs. The rich natural beauty, serenity and exotic flora and fauna of the area are invaluable resources for the development of  eco-tourism. Total  area of the  region is about 2,55,168 Sq. Km. All the seven states are members  of the  North East Council, organized on 1st  August 1972 and  within the Jurisdiction of Guwahati High Court.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">The region has a high concentration of tribal population. The states of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland are mostly inhabited by a number of native tribes. Each tribe has its own distinct tradition of art, culture, dance, music and life styles. The numerous fairs and festivals celebrated by these communities and their friendly nature are irresistible attractions for the visitors.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">The North East is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse regions in India. Each of the seven states that form this part of India has its own culture and tradition. Assam occupies the lush lowlands of the Brahmaputra Valleyand is the most densely populated. Arunachal Pradesh occupies the densely forested and sparsely populated foothills of the Himalayas, and is one of the major tourist attractions because of its Buddhist influence. Meghalaya, with its pine clad hills and lakes, is famous as the wettest region of the world. Nagaland has a rich war history that attracts tourists. The other three states -Manipur, known as the ‘land of jewels’, Mizoram and Tripura make up a fascinating area consisting of green valleys, lush hills with variety of flora and fauna.

You can also visit Arunachal Pradesh during September or in December to explore the calmness of Buddhist monasteries, snow, swift streams and beautifully cloudy peaks that will make you awestruck. During the last week of November and the first week of December; there are many festivals in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, and Nagaland; that is sure to grab your attention and keep you entertained. The weather in the northeast region is always unpredictable. There is endless rain in some parts which make them pleasant and bring in cold at the same time.

During the monsoons, there are glistening waterfalls and lush green surrounding that are a treat to the eyes. While in the winters there is sparkling snow that covers the entire area like a sheet. However, there are a lot of landslides during the months of monsoons, making it a bit of risk to travel on the roads of this area. However, at the end of the day, it is your choice as to what season you want to choose for visiting this pleasant place.

Each state has its own unique history and culture, and for a traveller, the region is a repository of rare experiences. It’s fascinating that even many Indians from outside the north-east region know so little about the place. If you’ve travelled across India but have never visited the north-east, here are the reasons to do so. Previously known as the Seven Sisters, north-east India became richer with the addition of an eighth, Sikkim in 1975. Before joining India as its 22nd state, Sikkim was a small Himalayan monarchy.

There’s Khonoma in Nagaland where the villagers banded together to stop unchecked deforestation by outsiders. Mawlynnong in Meghalaya was awarded the cleanest village in Asia and where all guesthouses are constructed of bamboo. The Apatani tribe of Ziro Valley in Arunachal Pradesh have developed their own unique sustainable methods of farming. Then there’s the breathtaking Khangchendzonga National Park in Sikkim. If you believe in the concept of green travel, then this is an absolutely unmissable destination.

                        </strong>One-horned rhinos were almost extinct by 1975, with only 600 of them remaining in the jungles of Nepal and India. Hunting and poaching for their horns were the two main causes behind the decline. But with dedicated efforts, the population of this endangered species has gone up to 3,500 and more than half of them reside in Kaziranga National Park in Assam. The national park also has the highest density of tigers in the world. Take a safari tour here and while you meet elephants, wild water buffaloes, swamp deers and a wide variety of birds, you can also admire the enormous work that Kaziranga National Park has put in towards wildlife conservation.

                        <strong>Rare gastronomic experience:
                        </strong> The cuisines from the eight north-eastern states couldn’t be more different from that of mainland Indian food. For one, the use of spices is kept to a minimum. Instead ingredients like soy bean and bamboo shoot in their fermented forms, add flavour to the dishes. During his trip to Nagaland, even Gordon Ramsay couldn’t believe he was dining in India. But it would be wrong to classify the cuisine from this region as one entity because each state varies in their style of cooking. Sikkim, for instance, is largely influenced by Tibetan and Nepali cuisine. However, what can be said with certainty is that gastronomes will be fascinated with their finds when travelling in this part of the country.

                        </strong> For the adventurous soul, north-east India presents some challenging trekking routes accompanied by spectacular views. The Bailey Trail Trek in Arunachal Pradesh follows the ancient trade route connecting India, Tibet and Myanmar. The Goechala Trek in West Sikkim is considered by many to be the closest comparison to the famed trekking routes of Nepal. Dzukou Valley, Beyul of Pemako, Green Lake, Reiek Mountain and Unakoti are some of the other treks you can explore in this region.

                        <strong>Sikkim, India’s first and only organic state: 
                        </strong>  It was in 2004 that Sikkim embarked upon a journey to become a fully organic state. It managed to achieve this ambitious feat 12 years later. Since then, the least populous and second smallest state of India, has become a shining jewel in India’s crown. There are many rural villages in Sikkim where travellers are welcome to experience hands-on organic farming while living with the locals in their humble homestays. Lachung, Lachen, Denchung and Kaluk are some of the popular villages you can visit.

                        <strong>Rare gastronomic experience:  
                        </strong>The cuisines from the eight north-eastern states couldn’t be more different from that of mainland Indian food. For one, the use of spices is kept to a minimum. Instead ingredients like soy bean and bamboo shoot in their fermented forms, add flavour to the dishes. During his trip to Nagaland, even Gordon Ramsay couldn’t believe he was dining in India. But it would be wrong to classify the cuisine from this region as one entity because each state varies in their style of cooking. Sikkim, for instance, is largely influenced by Tibetan and Nepali cuisine. However, what can be said with certainty is that gastronomes will be fascinated with their finds when travelling in this part of the country.

                        <strong>Eclectic culture: 
                        </strong> The culture of north-eastern states are characterised by the diverse ethnic groups settled in the region. Each tribe has its own distinct custom, cuisine, attire and dialect. One of these tribes is the Konyak, the last remaining headhunter clans of the region. Konyaks were once renowned for decapitating their enemies and proudly displaying them on their return to the village. With time, these age old customs are silently vanishing, but what the Konyaks teach us is that there’s a wealth of cultural experiences hidden within the mystical hills of north-east India.

                        </strong>
                        Northeast India is home to a large number of tribes and these tribes have a rich Handicraft tradition of their own. Bamboo works, especially, are widespread in the region. Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura have some very skilled bamboo craftsmen who make beautiful screens, lamp stands, furniture and baskets among other things. Manipur is recognized for gold and gold plated jewellery, Assam and Meghalaya for their silk textiles and Sikkim for carpet weaving. Pottery is also a commonly practiced craft in some of these states.

                        <strong>Find musical inspiration: 
                        </strong>
                        Northeast India is home to some of the best musicians in the country. However, most of them are very underrated. Western music, especially, is the source inspiration for most people in the region. Shillong, the capital town of Meghalaya, is also known as the Rock Music Capital of India. Legendary musician Lou Majaw hails from the state of Meghalaya, so does Soulmate, one of India’s best blues band. If you want to experience the brilliant music coming from north-east India, make sure to attend the Ziro Festival of Music in Arunachal Pradesh, which is a highly sought-after musical fixture in the country.
